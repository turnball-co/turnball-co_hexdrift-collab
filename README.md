# turnball-co_hexdrift-collab
Welcome to the contribution projects that have been associated with turnball.co, turndrift.co and hexball.co.  These various projects represent the individual pursuits of ben@turnball.co and hexdrift@gmail.com  as they're collaborating together in the realms of 3d printing, fabrication and other bespoke projects and implementations that have often featured IoT, Home Automation and other exciting and "why the hell not" sort of pursuits.

Its is hoped that by sharing these resources via Github, especially following Open Source type models, that the community might gain some benefit from the sharing of these resources.  As an active software engineer in the industry since the 90s, we'd like to encourage anyone to make use of these resources, ask questions and propose improvements wherever you might feel so inclined. 

Through the sharing of these projects we're hopeful that we might encourage others to take the initiative to improve their own world, products that they've purchased or created -- and deliver us all to a more productive, happy and enriched lives. Please ask questions wherever you might have them, offer suggestions or feedback wherever you feel so moved and we look forward to seeing you out there in the www!
