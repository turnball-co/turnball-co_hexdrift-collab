# Pico LED Shows

This area of controller code and operations represents some software and other controller configurations that are being created for the purpose of driving LED light effects for large models such as the various vessels for Star Trek.  Future expansions should also cover and include Star Wars models and taking us upon a journey of projects that empower one of our collaborators to realize their dreams of producing large movie quality effects and dioramas featuring 3d printed models in some otherwise excitingly sized aspect ratios.

More details and potentially content in the form of Youtube videos to follow as this project continues its way towards completion and maturation as we evolve the initiative.
